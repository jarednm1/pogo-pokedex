# Purpose

The purpose of this was to make it easy to copy and paste lists ofpokemon I want in trades for the popular mobile game Pokemon Go. You simply add the pokemon you have and it spits out the list of pokemon you still need. 

# Requirements

Outlined below are the required installations to make the magic happen:
## The Script
First, you need to download the entirety of this repository to your machine. This can be down easily by downloading a ZIP of it via the green "Code" button on GitHub. Extract the contents to wherever you wish to the files on your machine.

## Python
Installing Python on your machine is very simple. Simply install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

On Windows, customize the installation and check the box titled "Add Python to Enviroment Variables"

If you are unsure if Python is installed on your machine type ```python3 -v``` in your terminal/cmd/powershell. 

I wrote this using Python 3.9.5, any backwards compatibility is uncharted territory.

# Usage

There are two ways to execute this python script: The included .bat file and via the CMD Console. While they both work the same, the .bat file is included for the simplicity of the user.

## Using the .Bat File:
NOTE: This does NOT work on Mac/Linux (should add something that does this for them later)
 1. Navigate to the directory where the .bat file is located
 2. Simply double click the TakeSurvey.bat
 
## Via CMD Line:
1. Open your terminal/CMD Console
2. Navigate to the directory where the .py file is located
3. Enter the command 
```python3 PokemonGoDexTracker.py```
4. Press Enter
